## Contents  
  
  * ### **Data Analysis and Visualization**  
    
    * [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Data-Science/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets/Most_Requested_App_Profiles.ipynb): We assume to work for a company that builds Android and IOS mobile apps available on Google Play and Apple Store, our aim in this project is to analyze all english apps on Google Play and Apple Store in order to understand what are the features that make an app desirable for the users.  
    * [Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Data-Science/blob/master/Cleaning%20And%20Analyzing%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys/Cleaning%20And%20Analyzing%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys.ipynb): In this project we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education , Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following question: Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
    * [Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Data-Science/blob/master/Star%20Wars%20Survey/Star%20Wars%20Survey.ipynb): The team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered : does the rest of America realize that "The Empire Strikes Back" is clearly the best of the bunch ? The team collected data addresing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. Our aim is to clean, explore and analyze the data set in order to answer the question.
    * [Answering Business Questions Using SQL](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Data-Science/blob/master/Answering%20Business%20Questions%20using%20SQL/Answering%20Business%20Questions%20Using%20SQL.ipynb): We'll be working with a version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store. We'll use the SQL language to answer some business questions.
    * [Popular Data Science Questions](https://github.com/LucaMagini/Data-Science/blob/master/Popular%20Data%20Science%20Questions/Popular%20Data%20Science%20Questions.ipynb): Our goal in this project is to use Data Science Stack Exchange site to determine what content should a data science education company create, based on interest by subject.
